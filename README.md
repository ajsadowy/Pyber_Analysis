## Overview   
For this analysis, our goal was to see the impact of city types (urban, suburban, and rural) have on total fares (in US Dollars $) within a timeframe (January 1st, 2019 to April 29th, 2019). Were were able to produce a useful line graph the illustrates the comparison of city types within the environment of Fares vs Time.

## Results   
![LineGraph](https://github.com/ajsadowy/Pyber_Analysis/blob/main/AnalyticGraphics/Pyber_fare_summary_graph.png)   
From the line graph we do see a noticable difference of fares compared to each city type. While there are fluxuations over time for each city type's fares, they remain relatively leveled. The difference between each city type could be explained by population. Following basic economic principles of "Supply vs. Demand" this would be a credible explination for the difference. 
   
   Referencing our pyber_summary_df, there is a contrast of comparing the Average Fare per Ride and the Average Fare per Driver. A hypothesis that might explain this is drivers selecting high fare rides for a higher personal profit. This could warrant further research is to see how drivers select ride request they are willing to accept.

## Summary and Recommendations
In conclusion Pyber is following typical economic models of supply and demand. For further examination of the difference of Average Fare per Ride vs Average Fare per Driver, data should be collected on the decisions drivers make in choosing the ride requests they accept.
